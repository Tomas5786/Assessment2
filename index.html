          <h2 class="spacing"><span>Cybersecurity</span></h2>
          <h3>What is cybersecurity<br><br></h3>
          <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting hardware, sensitive data, software, and critical systems from digital attacks. Information technology security, also known as IT security places defence measures, to prevent networked systems and applications from being attacked, whether it is from inside or outside of an organisation (Shea, Gillis and Clark, 2021). As we transition further into a technological world and increasingly immerse ourselves with more technology into our everyday lives, so does the threat of personal and professional data breaches increase. Today we as a race are flooding the internet with additional personal information daily, whether it is through a new streaming service or subscribing to newsletters from one of our favourite brands. Professional organisations are just as guilty of this too, from sending emails to work colleagues and clients with sensitive information without appropriate protection in place or posting confidential data through messages on unprotected platforms. All these actions conducted online increase the chances and likelihood of data breaches and ransom from undesirable entities. Cybersecurity has become an essential service to help protect all from personal identifiable information theft, and professional information theft and ransom.
          <br><br></p>

          <h3>What is being done now<br><br></h3>
          <p>There are a multitude of threats that cybersecurity specialists must tackle to keep small to large organisations, and even your everyday person safe form cyber risks. These risks range from malware, ransomware, social engineering, phishing, spear phishing, insider threats, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) (Shea, Gillis and Clark, 2021). However, ransomware attacks are increasingly on the rise. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity spoke out in 2021 and said 150 percent increase of ransomware attacks were documented compared to the previous year and expect this to significantly rise well into 2022 (Robb, 2022). The complexity of modern computing combined the continuous threat of malware and ransomware attacks has many companies moving towards using the cloud for security solutions. These security solutions are usually handled by Managed-Service-providers (MSP). Moving forward in this step would allow a broader range of experts and specialists to be more involved with one another and create more secure systems. Ransomware attacks can be reduced by hiring (MSPs) and utilising their cloud-based security systems, as they are a much more impenetrable defence mechanisms to reduce these attacks. MSPs are also started utilising Artificial intelligence (AI) more into their security systems in recent years to help combat cyber strikes made towards corporations. AI security tools are used for detection, predication, and response to cybercriminal threats. However, for the time being a lot of organisations are not migrating towards this approach, and therefore are still falling victims to ransomware attacks. This is because not all business can afford the hefty price tag that comes along with such a service. If a business cannot afford such a service of an (MSP), then simple measures such as a good anti-virous software with cloud backup is a great start. This may eliminate the need to pay a ransom if your personal or business data become encrypted by an unwanted entity asking for payment in return for your own property. Also educating employees about phishing emails or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate organisation or source will greatly reduce the risk. (7 steps to help prevent & limit the impact of ransomware, 2020).
          <br><br></p>

          <h3>What is next for cybersecurity<br><br></h3>
          <p>The next big step for cloud-based security systems is incorporating more artificial intelligence (AI). The future of security systems will include a substantial amount more AI tools being utilised and incorporated into security procedures for the foreseeable future (CISOMAG, 2021). It is estimated by the year 2031 AI tools will be utilized in most all security systems due to being able to process and accomplish tasks more efficiently than humans, such as detecting and neutralising ransomware attacks before they reach the target (Stone, 2021).
          <br><br></p>

          <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced social and work face to face interactions, cloud-based platforms and security systems has been on the rise. Cloud-based systems have allowed many cybersecurity engineers and specials to collaboratively work more efficiently and with less constrains, due to not having to be in the same location at the same time. However, even if cloud-based security systems allow more people to work together to accomplish a task, so does the risk of more attacks increase while being online. Cloud security is more impenetrable and secure compared to local based security systems, but it is not one hundred per cent attack proof like any security measure. As security systems advance and become smarter so do hackers and cyber activists, this is a never-ending cycle that cybersecurity specialist face (Samtani, 2022).
          <br><br></p>

          <h3>Artificial intelligence<br><br></h3>
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) security tools are being incorporated increasingly into security. The potential impact of AI systems being utilised more in day-to-day security tasks to reduce ransomware and malware attacks is accomplishing duties more rapidly and without human error. Will AI security tools take jobs of seasoned cybersecurity professionals? The short answer is no, however, AI will significantly change the way cyber engineers and specialists work. In order to successfully implement new AI security technologies, cyber experts will need a new category of experts in the future to oversee such complex architectural systems (Will artificial intelligence replace cyber security jobs?, 2019). While AI may be able to process larges amount of data at humanly impossible speeds and predicting attacks before they happen, it will never replace the insight and understanding of an analyst of the security field. Humans and AI are not in conflict in this IT sector, in fact they accompany each other remarkably. Using cloud-based security systems and AI tools will create new skillsets and job roles for future cybersecurity specialist (What is cloud security?, 2018).
          <br><br></p>

          <h3>Outcomes and future for the industry<br><br></h3>
          <p>The introduction of cloud-based security systems and AI working collaboratively together holds a bright future for not only myself, but others too who aspire to work in the industry. Bring AI and cloud security into the IT security sector has opened a lot of doors as far as job opportunities go. As AI security tools are utilised more in a daily basis to help combat ransomware and other malicious cyber activities, a new breed of cyber security engineers and specialists with a new skillset will be born. Having Managed-Service-Providers (MSPs) using cloud-based security systems to maintain defence mechanisms for an organisation broadens the horizon for job opportunities as well. Being able to work for an MSP on the other side of the world and in a different time zone allows many people to work from the comfort of their own home. Also, if the past few years have tough us anything with COVID-19, it has placed many restrictions on where we can and cannot go, or with whom we can interact. Working remotely and efficiently with others in these new security systems removes the restriction of people collaborating in a working environment.
